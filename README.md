# Approach
The Approach was pretty straight forward. I started by creating a react app using the command npx create-react-app
After that I decided on which Components I was going to use, all the components are in the components folder

# Tech Stack
The tech stack I used is simple-
React for the frontend
Express and node for the backend
Mongo DB for the database

For authentication I used Auth0 third party website
To pass variables, props, states between the components,I made use of react context api

# Note
Since I had such sort notice, and my new backend was repetedly failing, I used an existing one, hence te weird random Images on the products page, that backend was never meant to be used for an assignment.
To proceed for the final payment, the user has to login,I don't guarantee that the authentication will work fully as during development also the third party site had some issues.
